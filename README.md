## Translations

We accept patches for documentation translation. Please send the
documents as a pull request and follow two guidelines:

1. Name the files identically to the originals but put them in a
   directory that matches the language locale. For example: JA\_JP,
   ZH\_CN or KO\_KN.

2. Add an explanation about the translated document to the top of the
   file: "These documents were localized into Esperanto by Community
   Member <person@example.com> and last updated on 2014-04-04. If you
   find inaccuracies or problems please file an issue on GitHub."

Thank you for your contributions.
