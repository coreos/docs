# BitTorrent-based distribution

Quay Enterprise supports BitTorrent-based distribution of its images to clients via the [quayctl](https://github.com/coreos/quayctl) tool. BitTorrent-based distribution allows for machines to share image data amongst themselves, resulting in faster downloads and shorter production launch times.
