## Generate an auth key

To connect Quay Enterprise securely to the scanner, click "Create Key >" to create an authentication key between Quay and the Security Scanner.

### Authentication for high-availability scanners

If the security scanning engine is running on multiple instances in a high-availability setup, select "Generate shared key":

Enter an optional expiration date, and click "Generate Key":

**Save the key ID and download the preshared private key into the configuration directory for the security scanning engine.**

### Authentication for single-instance scanners

If the security scanning engine is being run on a single instance, select "Have the service provide a key":

<img src="img/security-scanner-service-provide-key.png" class="img-center" alt="Security Scanner Service Provide Key"/>

Once the following dialog is visible, run the security scanning engine:

<img src="img/security-scanner-service-awaiting-key.png" class="img-center" alt="Security Scanner Service Awaiting Key"/>

When the security scanning engine connects, the key will be automatically approved.

## Save configuration
