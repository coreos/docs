# Clair Setup

<img src="img/Clair_horizontal_color.png" class="img-center" alt="Clair Security Scanner"/>

The <a href="https://github.com/coreos/clair">Clair</a> project is an open source engine that powers [Quay Security Scanner](security-scanning.md) to detect vulnerabilities in all images within Quay Enterprise, and notify developers as those issues are discovered.

## Initial Setup

### Postgres Database

In order to run Clair, a Postgres database is required. For production deployments, we recommend a PostgreSQL database running on machines other than those running Quay Enterprise, and ideally with automatic replication and failover.

#### Postgres database for testing

For testing purposes, a single PostgreSQL instance can be started locally:

```
docker run --name postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
sleep 5
docker run --rm --link postgres:postgres postgres sh -c 'echo "create database clairtest" | psql -h "$POSTGRES_PORT_5432_TCP_ADDR" -p "$POSTGRES_PORT_5432_TCP_PORT" -U postgres'
```

The configuration string for this test database is `postgresql://postgres@{DOCKER HOST GOES HERE}:5432/clairtest?sslmode=disable`.

### Download the Clair image

Pull the security-enabled Clair image:

```
docker pull quay.io/coreos/clair-jwt:v2.0.0
```

### Make a configuration directory for Clair

```
mkdir clair-config
cd clair-config
```

## Configure Clair

Clair can run either as a single instance or in high-availability mode. It is recommended to run more than a single instance of Clair, ideally in an auto-scaling group with automatic healing.

Create a `config.yaml` file in the config directory with the following contents, replacing appearances of { VARIABLE } with the appropriate value.

### Clair configuration: High availability

### Configuring Clair for TLS

To configure Clair to run with TLS, a few additional steps are required:

1. Generate a TLS certificate and key pair for the DNS name at which Clair will be accessed
2. Place these files as `clair.crt` and `clair.key` in your Clair configuration directory
3. Uncomment the `key_file` and `crt_file` lines under `verifier_proxies` in your Clair `config.yaml`

If your certificates use a public CA, you are now ready to run Clair. If you are using your own certificate authority, configure Clair to trust it below.

### Configuring trust of self-signed SSL

Similar to the process for setting up Docker to [trust your self-signed certificates][registry-self-signed], Clair must also be configured to trust your certificates. Using the same CA certificate bundle used to configure Docker, complete the following steps:

1. Rename the same CA certificate bundle used to set up Quay Registry to `ca.crt`
2. Make sure the `ca.crt` file is mounted inside the Clair container under `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` as in the example below:

```
docker run --restart=always -p 6060:6060 -p 6061:6061 -v /path/to/clair/config/directory:/config -v /path/to/quay/cert/ca.crt:/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca.crt -d quay.io/coreos/clair-jwt:v2.0.0
```

Now Clair will be able to trust the source of your TLS certificates and use them to secure communication between Clair and Quay.

## Run Clair

Execute the following command to run Clair:

```
docker run --restart=always -p 6060:6060 -p 6061:6061 -v /path/to/clair/config/directory:/config quay.io/coreos/clair-jwt:v2.0.0
```

Output similar to the following will be seen on success:

```

```

To verify Clair is running, execute the following command:

```
curl -X GET -I http://path/to/clair/here:6061/health
```

If a `200 OK` code is returned, Clair is running:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: clair

Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
```

## Continue with Quay Setup

Once Clair setup is complete, continue with [Quay Security Scanner Setup](security-scanning.md).
