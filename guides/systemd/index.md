# Getting Started wtih systemd

systemd is an init system that provides many powerful features for starting, stopping and managing processes. Within the CoreOS world, you will almost exclusively use systemd to manage the lifecycle of your Docker containers.

## Terminology

systemd consists of two main concepts: a unit and a target. A unit is a configuration file that describes the properties of the process that you'd like to run. This is normally a `docker run` command or somethng similar. A target is a grouping mechanism that allows systemd to start up groups of processes at the same time. This happens at every boot as processes are started at different run levels.

systemd is the first process started on CoreOS and it reads different targets and starts the processes specified which allows the operating system to start. The target that you'll interact with is the `local.target` which holds all of the unit files for our containers.

Each target is actually a collection of symlinks to our unit files. Running `systemctl restart local-enable.service` creates symlinks to any unit file that should reside in `local.target`. This is specified in the unit file by `WantedBy=local.target`.

## Unit File

On CoreOS, unit files are located within the R/W filesystem at `/media/state/units`. Let's take a look at a simple unit file:

```
[Unit]
Description=My Service
After=docker.service

[Service]
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run busybox /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo Hello World; sleep 1; done"

[Install]
WantedBy=local.target
```

The description shows up in the systemd log and a few other places. Write something that will help you understand exactly what this does later on.

`After=docker.service` means this unit will only start after `docker.service` is active. You can define as many of these as you want.

`Restart=always` is pretty obvious. This is helpful if your container is designed to exit for some reason but you'd like to start up an identical container when that happens.

`ExecStart=` allows you to specify any command that you'd like to run when this unit is started.

`WantedBy=` is the target that this unit is a part of.

## Advanced Unit Files

systemd provides a high degree of functionality in your unit files. Here's a curated list of useful features listed in the order they'll occur in the lifecycle of a unit:

| Name    | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ExecStartPre | Commands that will run before `ExecStart`. |
| ExecStart | Main commands to run for this unit. |
| ExecStartPost | Commands that will run after all `ExecStart` commands have completed. |
| ExecReload | Commands that will run when this unit is reload via `systemctl reload foo.service` |
| ExecStop | Commands that will run when this unit is considered failed or if it is stopped via `systemctl stop foo.service` |
| ExecStopPost | Commands that will run after `ExecStop` has completed. |
| RestartSec | The amount of time to sleep before restarting a serivce. Useful to prevent your failed service from attempting to restart itself every 100ms. |

The full list is located on the [systemd man page](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html).

Let's put a few of these concepts togther to register new units within etcd. Imagine we had another container running that would read these values from etcd and act upon them.

Since our `docker run` command will be `ExecStart`, it makes sense for our etcd command to run as `ExecStartPost` to ensure that our container is started and functioning.

We also need to clean up our etcd key when the container exits or the unit is failed by using `ExecStopPost`.

```
[Unit]
Description=My Advanced Service
After=etcd.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run -d -p 80:80 coreos/apache /usr/sbin/apache2ctl -D FOREGROUND
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/etcdctl set /domains/example.com/10.10.10.123:8081 running
ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/etcdctl delete /domains/example.com/10.10.10.123:8081
RestartSec=10s

[Install]
WantedBy=local.target
```

## Unit Variables

If our last example we had to hardcode our IP address when we announced our container in etcd. That's not scalable and systemd has a few variables built in to help us out. Here's a few of the most useful:

| Variable | Meaning | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `%n` | Full unit name | Useful if the name of your unit is unique enough to be used as an argument on a command. |
| `%m` | Machine ID | Useful for namespacing etcd keys by machine. Example: `/machines/%m/units` |
| `%b` | BootID | Same as Machine ID. This value is random and changes on each boot |
| `%H` | Hostname | Allows you to run the same unit file across many machines. Useful for service discovery. Example: `/domains/example.com/%H:8081` |

A full list is on the [systemd man page](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html).

## Instantiated Units

Since systemd is based on symlinks, there are a few interesting tricks you can leverage that are very powerful when used with containers. If you create multiple symlinks to the same unit file, the following variables become available to you:

| Variable | Meaning | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `%p` | Prefix name | Refers to any string before `@` in your unit name. |
| `%i` | Instance name | Refers to the string between the `@` and the suffix. |

In our earlier example we had to hardcode our IP address when registering within etcd:

```
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/etcdctl set /domains/example.com/10.10.10.123:8081 running
```

We can enhance this by using `%H` and `%i` to dynamically announce the hostname and port. Specify the port after the `@` by using two unit files named `foo@123.service` and `foo@456.service`:

```
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/etcdctl set /domains/example.com/%H:%i running
```

This gives us the flexiblity to use a single unit file to announce multiple copies of the same container on a both a single machine (no port overlap) and on multiple machines (no hostname overlap).
