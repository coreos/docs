# Setup GitHub Build Triggers

CoreOS Enterprise Registry supports using GitHub or GitHub Enterprise as a trigger to building
images.

## Initial Setup

If you have not yet done so, please <a href="{{site.url}}/docs/enterprise-registry/build-support/">enable build support</a> in the Enterprise Registry.

## Create an OAuth Application in GitHub

The first step in supporting GitHub Build is to create an OAuth Application representing the
Enterprise Registry *for building* in GitHub or GitHub Enterprise.

*Note:* A *separate* application must be setup for GitHub build, independent of the one used for [GitHub Authentication]({{site.url}}/docs/enterprise-registry/github-auth/).

- Log into GitHub (Enterprise)
- Visit the applications page under your organization's settings and click "<a href="https://github.com/settings/applications/new">Register New Application</a>".

- Enter your registry's URL as the application URL

Note: If using public GitHub, the URL entered must be accessible by *your users*. It can still be an internal URL.

- Enter `https://{REGISTRY URL HERE}/oauth2/github/callback` as the Authorization callback URL.
- Create the application and note down the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

## Change the Feature Flag

Next, in the Enteprise Registry `config.yaml`, change the following to enable GitHub Build:

```yaml
FEATURE_GITHUB_BUILD: false
```

to

```yaml
FEATURE_GITHUB_BUILD: true
```

## Configure the Feature

In the Enteprise Registry `config.yaml`, add the following section:

```yaml

# For GitHub Enterprise building
GITHUB_TRIGGER_CONFIG: {
  'GITHUB_ENDPOINT': '(GITHUB ENTERPRISE ENDPOINT HERE)',
  'CLIENT_ID': '(CLIENT ID)',
  'CLIENT_SECRET': '(CLIENT SECRET)',
}

# For GitHub.com building
GITHUB_TRIGGER_CONFIG: {
  'GITHUB_ENDPOINT': 'https://github.com/',
  'API_ENDPOINT': 'https://api.github.com/',
  'CLIENT_ID': '(CLIENT ID)',
  'CLIENT_SECRET': '(CLIENT SECRET)',
}
```

## Tag an Automated Build

After getting automated builds working, it may be desired to tag a specific build with a name. By default, the last image pushed to a repository will be tagged as `latest`.
Because tagging is [usually done client side](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerimages/#setting-tags-on-an-image) before an image is pushed, it may not be clear how to tag an image that was built and pushed by GitHub. Luckily, there is a interface for doing so on the repository page. After clicking to select a given build on the build graph, the right side of the page displays tag information which when clicked provides a drop-down menu with the option of creating a new tag.

Trying to find a specific image for a commit after it is no longer tagged as latest? The build name (visible in the build history of a repository) will match the commit SHA value.

There is currently no ability to automatically tag GitHub triggered builds.
