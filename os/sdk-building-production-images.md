# Building production images

In general the automated process should always be used but in a pinch putting together a release manually may be necessary. All release information is tracked in the [manifest][coreos-manifest] git repository which is usually organized like so:

 * build-109.xml (previous release manifest)
 * build-115.xml (current release manifest)
 * master.xml    (master branch manifest)
 * version.txt   (current version information)
 * default.xml -> master.xml
 * release.xml -> build-115.xml

## Tagging releases

The first step of building a release is updating and tagging the release in the manifest git repository. A typical release off of master involves the following steps:

 1. Make sure you are on the master branch: `repo init -b master`
 2. Sync/checkout source, excluding local changes: `repo sync --detach`
 3. In the scripts directory: `./tag_release --push`

That was far too easy, if you need to do it the hard way try this:

 1. Make sure you are on the master branch: `repo init -b master`
 2. Sync/checkout source, excluding local changes: `repo sync --detach`
 3. Switch to the somewhat hidden manifests checkout: `cd .repo/manifests`
 4. Update `version.txt` with the desired version number.
    * COREOS_BUILD is the major version number, and should be the number of days since July 1st, 2013. COREOS_BRANCH should start at 0 and is incremented for every normal release based on a particular COREOS_BUILD version. COREOS_PATCH is reserved for exceptional situations such as emergency manual releases and should normally be 0.
    * The complete version string is COREOS_BUILD.COREOS_BRANCH.COREOS_PATCH
    * COREOS_SDK_VERSION should be the complete version string of an existing build. The `cros_sdk` uses this to pick what SDK tarball to use when creating a fresh chroot and provides a fallback set of binary packages to use when the current release's packages are unavailable. Usually it will be one release behind COREOS_BUILD.
 5. Generate a release manifest: `repo manifest -r -o build-$BUILD.xml` where `$BUILD` is the current value of COREOS_BUILD in `version.txt`.
 6. Update `release.xml`: `ln -sf build-$BUILD.xml release.xml`
 7. Commit! `git add build-$BUILD.xml; git commit -a`
 8. Tag! `git tag v$BUILD.$BRANCH.$PATCH`
 9. Push! `git push origin HEAD:master HEAD:dev-channel HEAD:build-$BUILD v$BUILD.$BRANCH.$PATCH`

If a release branch needs to be updated after master has moved on the procedure is similar. Unfortunately since tagging branched releases (not on master) is a bit trickier to get right the `tag_release` script cannot be used. The automated build will kick off after updating the `dev-channel` branch.

 1. Check out the release instead of master: `repo init -b build-$BUILD -m release.xml`
 2. Sync, cherry-pick, push, and whatever else is required to publish the desired changes in the repo-managed projects. If the desired changes are already published (such as if you are just updating to a later commit from a project's master branch) then this can be skipped.
 3. `cd .repo/manifests`
 4. Update `version.txt` as desired. Usually just increment COREOS_PATCH.
 5. Update `build-$BUILD.xml` as desired. The output of `repo manifest -r` shouldn't be used verbatim this time because it won't generate meaningful values for the `upstream` project attribute when starting from a release manifest instead of `master.xml` but it can be useful for looking up the git commit to update the `revision` attribute to. If the new git commit is on a branch other than master be sure to update the `upstream` attribute with the appropriate ref spec for that branch.
 6. If this is the first time this branch has been updated on its own update the `default.xml` link so checking out this manifest branch with repo init but without the `-m` argument works: `ln -sf build-$BUILD.xml default.xml`
 7. Commit! `git commit -a`
 8. Tag! `git tag v$BUILD.$BRANCH.$PATCH`
 9. Push! `git push origin HEAD:dev-channel HEAD:build-$BUILD v$BUILD.$BRANCH.$PATCH`

Now you can start building images! This will build an image that can be ran under KVM and uses near production values.

Note: Add `COREOS_OFFICIAL=1` here if you are making a real release. That will change the version to leave off the build id suffix.

```sh
./build_image prod --group alpha
```

The generated production image is bootable as-is by qemu but for a larger ROOT partition or VMware images use `image_to_vm.sh` as described in the final output of `build_image`.

## Automated builds

Automated release builds are triggered by pushes to the `dev-channel` branch in the manifest repository.

Note: In the future builds will be triggered by pushing new tags instead of using the `dev-channel` branch; the branch only exists due to a limitation of the current buildbot deployment.

## Pushing updates into CoreUpdate

The automated build host does not have access to production signing keys so the final signing and push to roller must be done elsewhere. The `coreos_production_update.zip` archive provides the tools required to do this so a full SDK setup is not required. This does require gsutil to be installed and configured. An update payload signed by the insecure development keys is generated automatically as `coreos_production_update.gz` and `coreos_production_update.meta`. If needed the raw filesystem image used to generate the payload is `coreos_production_update.bin.bz2`. As an example, to publish the insecurely signed payload:

```sh
URL=gs://builds.release.core-os.net/alpha/amd64-usr/321.0.0
cd $(mktemp -d)
gsutil -m cp $URL/coreos_production_update* ./
gpg --verify coreos_production_update.zip.sig
gpg --verify coreos_production_update.gz.sig
gpg --verify coreos_production_update.meta.sig
unzip coreos_production_update.zip
 ./core_roller_upload --user <you>@coreos.com --api_key <yourkey>
```

Note: prefixing the command with a space will avoid recording your API key in your bash history if `$HISTCONTROL` is `ignorespace` or `ignoreboth`.
