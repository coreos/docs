# Adding users

You can create user accounts on a CoreOS machine manually with `useradd` or via cloud-config when the machine is created.

## Add users via cloud-config

Managing users via cloud-config is preferred because it allows you to use the same configuration across many servers and the cloud-config file can be stored in a repo and versioned. In your cloud-config, you can specify many [different parameters]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/cluster-management/setup/cloudinit-cloud-config/#users) for each user. Here's an example:

```yaml
#cloud-config

users:
  - name: elroy
    passwd: $6$5s2u6/jR$un0AvWnqilcgaNB3Mkxd5yYv6mTlWfOoCYHZmfi3LDKVltj.E8XNKEcwWm...
    groups:
      - sudo
      - docker
    ssh-authorized-keys:
      - ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDGdByTgSVHq.......
```

## Add Users via Ignition

Managing users via Ignition is preferred because it allows you to use the same configuration across many servers and the Ignition config can be stored in a repo and versioned. In your Ignition config, you can specify many [different parameters](https://github.com/coreos/ignition/blob/master/doc/configuration.md) for each user. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "ignition": { "version": "2.0.0" },
  "passwd": {
    "users": [{
      "name": "elroy",
      "passwordHash": "$6$5s2u6/jR$un0AvWnqilcgaNB3Mkxd5yYv6mTlWfOoCYHZmfi3LDKVltj.E8XNKEcwWm...",
      "sshAuthorizedKeys": [ "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDGdByTgSVHq......." ],
      "create": {
        "groups": ["sudo", "docker"]
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

## Add user manually

If you'd like to add a user manually, SSH to the machine and use the `useradd` tool. To create the user `user`, run:

```sh
sudo useradd -p "*" -U -m user1 -G sudo
```

The `"*"` creates a user that cannot login with a password but can log in via SSH key. `-U` creates a group for the user, `-G` adds the user to the existing `sudo` group and `-m` creates a home directory. If you'd like to add a password for the user, run:

```sh
$ sudo passwd user1
New password:
Re-enter new password:
passwd: password changed.
```

To assign an SSH key, run:

```sh
update-ssh-keys -u user1 user1.pem
```

## Grant sudo Access

If you trust the user, you can grant administrative privileges using `visudo`. `visudo` checks the file syntax before actually overwriting the `sudoers` file. This command should be run as root to avoid losing sudo access in the event of a failure. Instead of editing `/etc/sudo.conf` directly you will create a new file under the `/etc/sudoers.d/` directory. When you run visudo, it is required that you specify which file you are attempting to edit with the `-f` argument: 

```sh
# visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/user1
```

Add a the line:

```
user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Check that sudo has been granted:

```sh
# su user1
$ cat /etc/sudoers.d/user1
cat: /etc/sudoers.d/user1: Permission denied

$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers.d/user1
user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
